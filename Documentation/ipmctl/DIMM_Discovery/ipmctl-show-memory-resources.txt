===============================
endif::manpage[]

NAME
----
ipmctl-show-memory-resources - Shows the total DCPMM memory resource allocation

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -memoryresources

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows the total DCPMM memory resource allocation across the host server.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

-u (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
-units (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
  Changes the units that capacities are displayed in for this command. One of:
  bytes (B), megabytes (MB), mebibytes (MiB), gigabytes (GB), gibibytes (GiB),
  terabytes (TB) or tebibytes (TiB).

EXAMPLES
--------
Shows the DCPMM memory resource allocation.
[verse]
ipmctl show -memoryresources

RETURN DATA
-----------
Returns the default attributes listed below.

NOTE: Capacities from unmanageable DCPMMs are not included in the following
aggregated totals.

Capacity::
  Total system DCPMM capacity.

MemoryCapacity::
  Total usable system DCPMM Memory Mode capacity.

AppDirectCapacity::
  Total usable system DCPMM App Direct capacity.

UnconfiguredCapacity::
  Total system DCPMM capacity that is unusable because it has not been configured.

ReservedCapacity::
  Total system DCPMM persistent memory capacity that is reserved. This capacity
  is the persistent memory partition capacity less any App Direct capacity
  rounded to App Direct alignment. Reserved capacity typically results from
  a Memory Allocation Goal request that specifices the Reserved property. This
  capacity not mapped to system physical address (SPA) space.

InaccessibleCapacity::
  Total system DCPMM capacity that is inaccessible due any of:
  - Platform configuration prevents accessing this capacity. e.g. MemoryCapacity is
    configured but MemoryMode is not enabled by platform FW (current Memory Mode is 1LM).
  - Capacity is inaccessible because it is not mapped into the system physical
    address space (SPA). This is usually due to platform firmware memory alignment requirements.
  - DCPMM configured capacity but SKU prevents usage. e.g. AppDirectCapcity but
    DCPMM SKU is MemoryMode only.

DETAILS
-------
DCPMMs are partitioned into Memory and Persistent partitions. These partitions must
be aligned to 1 GiB boundaries. Any capacity that falls outside the Memory and
Persistent partitions is ReservedCapacity and is not useable.

Furthermore, platform firmware alignment restrictions may result in some capacity from the
Persistent partition not mapped to system physical address (SPA) space. This memory is considered
InaccessibleCapacity and is not usable.

Definitions:

Capacity::
  Raw Capacity reported by DCPMM DIMM Partition Info

Memory Partition Capacity::
  Volatile Capacity reported by DCPMM DIMM Partition Info

Persistent Partition Capacity::
  Persistent Capacity reported by DCPMM DIMM Partition Info

Volatile Memory Size::
  Usable voliatile memory capacity as reported by platform FW
  via _Intel NVDIMM Current Config->Volatile Memory Size Mapped into SPA_ field

Persistent Memory Size::
  Usable persistent memory capacity as reported by platform FW via
  _Intel NVDIMM Current Config->Persistent Memory Size Mapped into SPA_ field

DCPMM DIMM Partition Info::
  DIMM Partition Info provided by DCPMM firmware. See _Intel(R) Optane(TM)
  DC Persistent Memory Module Firmware Interface Specification_ for details.

Intel NVDIMM Current Config::
  See _Intel(R) NVM Dimm Management Software-Firmware Interface Specification_
  for details.

Calculations:

[verse]
MemoryCapacity = Volatile Memory Capacity

[verse]
AppDirectCapacity = Persistent Memory Size

[verse]
InaccessibleCapacity = Persistent Partition Capacity - Persistent Memory Size

[verse]
ReservedCapacity = Capacity - Memory Partition Capacity - Persistent Partition Capacity
