NAME
----
ipmctl-delete-goal - Deletes the memory allocation goal from DCPMMs

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl delete [OPTIONS] -goal [TARGETS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Deletes the memory allocation goal from one or more DCPMMs. This command only
deletes a memory allocation goal request that has not been processed by BIOS.

NOTE: Deleting a memory allocation goal modifies how the platform maps persistent
memory, but does not explicitly delete or modify user data found in persistent
memory.

OPTIONS

-help::
    Displays help for the command.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
    Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

TARGETS
-------
-dimm (DimmIDs)::
  Deletes the memory allocation goal from specific DCPMMs by supplying one or
  more commaseparated DCPMM identifiers. The default is to delete the memory
  allocation goals from all manageable DCPMMs.

-socket (SocketIds)::
  Deletes the memory allocation goal from the DCPMMs on specific sockets by
  supplying the socket target and one or more comma-separated socket
  identifiers. The default is to delete the memory allocation goals from
  manageable DCPMMs on all sockets.

The appropriate privileges and the specified DCPMM(s) must be manageable by the
host software and unlocked if security is enabled.
given socket and all specified DCPMMs must contain a memory allocation goal.

RETURN DATA
-----------
For each DCPMM, the CLI will indicate the status of the operation. If a failure occurs
when deleting the memory allocation goals from multiple DCPMMs, the process will
output a failure message for those DCPMMs that did not succeed and a success
message for those that did.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------

Delete memory allocation goal from DIMM (DimmID): Success
Delete memory allocation goal from DIMM (DimmID): Error:
