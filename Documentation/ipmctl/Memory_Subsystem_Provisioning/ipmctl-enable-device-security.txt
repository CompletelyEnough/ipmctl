ipmctl-enable-device-security(1)
================================
endif::manpage[]

NAME
----
ipmctl-enable-device-security - Enable data-at-rest security on DCPMM

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl set [OPTIONS] -dimm [TARGETS] NewPassphrase=(string)
ConfirmPassphrase=(string)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Enable data-at-rest security for the persistent memory on one or more DCPMEM
modules by setting a passphrase.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-source (path)::
  File path to a local file containing the new passphrase (1-32 characters).

NOTE: The file does not need to contain the ConfirmPassphrase property

TARGETS
-------
-dimm (DimmIDs)::
  Set the passphrase on specific DCPMEM modules by supplying one or more comma
  separated DCPMEM module identifiers. However, this is not recommended as it
  may put the system in an undesirable state. The default is to set the
  passphrase on all manageable DCPMEM modules.

PROPERTIES
----------
NewPassphrase::
  The new passphrase (1-32 characters). For better passphrase protection,
  specify an empty string (e.g., NewPassphrase="") to be prompted for the
  passphrase or to use a file containing the passphrase with the source option.

ConfirmPassphrase::
  Confirmation of the new passphrase (1-32 character and must match
  NewPassphrase). For better passphrase protection, specify an empty string
  (e.g., ConfirmPassphrase="") to be prompted for the passphrase or to use a
  file containing the passphrase with the source option.

EXAMPLES
--------
Set a passphrase on DIMM 0x0001.
[verse]
ipmctl set -dimm 0x0001 NewPassphrase=123 ConfirmPassphrase=123

Sets a passphrase on DCPMEM module 1234 by supplying the passphrase in the file
mypassphrase.file. In this example, the format of the file would be:

#ascii +
NewPassphrase=myNewPassphrase

[verse]
ipmctl set -source mypassphrase.file -dimm 1234 NewPassphrase="" ConfirmPassphrase=""

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

The caller must have the appropriate privileges. The specified DCPMM must
have security disabled and be manageable by the host software.

There must not be any goal creation pending.

ifdef::os_build[]
Command is subject to OS Vendor (OSV) support. If OSV does not provide support,
command will return "Not Supported."
endif::os_build[]

RETURN DATA
-----------
If empty strings are provided for the passphrase properties and the source option is not
included, the user will be prompted (once for all DCPMEM modules) to enter the new
passphrase and then again to confirm the new passphrase as described below. The
passphrase characters will be hidden.

New passphrase: \\****
 +
Confirm new passphrase: \****

For each DCPMEM module, the CLI will indicate the status of the set passphrase
operation. If a failure occurs when setting the passphrase on multiple DCPMEM
modules, the process will exit and not continue updating the remaining DCPMEM
modules.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
------------
[verse]
Set passphrase on DIMM (DimmID): Success
...
Set passphrase on DIMM (DimmID): Error (Code) - (Description)
