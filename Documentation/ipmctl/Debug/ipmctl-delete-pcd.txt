NAME
----
ipmctl-delete-pcd - Clears the namespace label storage area partition

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Clears the namespace label storage area partition in the platform configuration
data from one or more DCPMMs. This is a destructive operation which will clear
the entire namespace label storage area including all namespaces labels and the
namespace label index block in order to re-purpose the DCPMM(s) for use in a
different operating system.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl delete [OPTIONS] -dimm (DimmIds) -pcd LSA

OPTIONS
-------
-f::
-force::
  Deleting the namespace label storage area is a destructive operation which
  requires confirmation from the user for each DCPMM. This option suppresses the
  confirmation.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

TARGETS
-------
-dimm (DimmIDs)::
  Deletes the namespace label storage area on specific DCPMMs by supplying one
  or more comma-separated DCPMM identifiers. The default is to delete the
  namespace label storage area for all manageable DCPMMs.

-pcd LSA::
  Clears the namespace label storage area partition in the platform
  configuration data. The management configuration data is not cleared.

EXAMPLES
--------
Clears the namespace label storage area from all manageable DCPMMs
[verse]
show -dimm -pcd Config

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The specified DCPMM(s) must be manageable by the host software, and if
data-at-rest security is enabled, the DCPMMs must be unlocked. Any existing
namespaces associated with the requested DCPMM(s) should be deleted before
running this command.

RETURN DATA
-----------
For each DCPMM, the CLI will indicate the status of the operation. If a failure occurs
when deleting the platform configuration data from multiple DCPMMs, the process will
continue deleting the remaining DCPMMs.
