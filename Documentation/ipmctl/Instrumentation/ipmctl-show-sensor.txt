=====================

NAME
----
ipmctl-show-sensor - Shows health statistics for one or more DCPMMs

DESCRIPTION
-----------
ipmctl-show-device to view more detailed information about a DCPMM.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -sensor [SENSORS] [TARGETS]

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
-all::
  Shows all attributes.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-d (attributes)::
-display (attributes)::
  Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma-separated
  list of any of the attributes defined in the Return Data section.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

SENSORS
-------
Health::
  (Default) The current DCPMM health as reported in the SMART log

MediaTemperature::
  (Default) The current DCPMM media temperature in Celsius

ControllerTemperature::
  (Default) The current DCPMM controller temperature in Celsius

PercentageRemaining::
  (Default) Remaining DCPMM’s life as a percentage value of factory expected
  life span

DirtyShutdowns::
  (Default) The number of shutdowns without notification over the lifetime of
  the DCPMM

UnlatchedDirtyShutdowns::
  (Default) The number of shutdowns without notification over the lifetime of
  the DCPMM. This counter is the same as DirtyShutdowns except it will always be
  incremented on a dirty shutdown, even if Latch System Shutdown Status was not
  enabled

PowerOnTime::
  (Default) The total power-on time over the lifetime of the DCPMM

UpTime::
  (Default) The total power-on time since the last power cycle of the DCPMM

PowerCycles::
  (Default) The number of power cycles over the lifetime of the DCPMM

FwErrorCount::
  The total number of firmware error log entries

TARGETS
-------
-dimm (DimmIDs)::
  Restricts output to the sensors on specific DCPMMs by supplying the DIMM
  target and one or more comma-separated DCPMM identifiers. The default is to
  display sensors for all manageable DCPMMs.

EXAMPLES
--------
Gets all sensor information for all DCPMMs.
[verse]
ipmctl show -sensor

Shows the media temperature sensor for the specified DCPMM.
[verse]
ipmctl show -sensor MediaTemperature -dimm 1234

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The specified DCPMM(s) must be manageable by the host software.

RETURN DATA
-----------
This command displays a table with a row for each sensor on each DCPMM. Applying
a specific DCPMM or sensor type target limits the number of rows. Applying
options can be used to expand or restrict the output.

DimmID::
  (Default) The DCPMM identifier

Type::
  (Default) The sensor type. Refer to the sensor table above.

CurrentValue::
  (Default) The current reading followed by the units of measurement
  (e.g., 57 °C or 25%)

CurrentState::
  (Default) The current value in relation to the threshold settings
  (if supported). One of:
  - Unknown: The state cannot be determined.
  - Normal: The current reading is within the normal range. This is the default
    when the sensor does not support thresholds.
  - NonCritical: The current reading is within the non-critical range. For
    example, an alarm threshold has been reached.
  - Critical: The current reading is within the critical range. For example, the
    firmware has begun throttling down traffic to the DCPMM due to the
    temperature.
  - Fatal: The current reading is within the fatal range. For example, the
    firmware is shutting down the DCPMM due to the temperature.

LowerThresholdNonCritical::
  The threshold value below which the state is considered “NonCritical”.

UpperThresholdNonCritical::
  The threshold value at or above which the state is considered “NonCritical”.

LowerThresholdCritical::
  The threshold value below which the state is considered “Critical”.

UpperThresholdCritical::
  The threshold value at or above which the state is considered "Critical".

UpperThresholdFatal::
  The threshold value at or above which the state is considered "Fatal".

SettableThresholds::
  A list of user settable thresholds. Zero or more of:
  - "LowerThresholdNonCritical"
  - "UpperThresholdNonCritical"

SupportedThresholds::
  A list of supported thresholds. Zero or more of:
  - "LowerThresholdNonCritical"
  - "UpperThresholdNonCritical"
  - "LowerThresholdCritical"
  - "UpperThresholdCritical"
  - "UpperThresholdFatal"

EnabledState::
  Whether the critical threshold alarm is enabled, disabled or not applicable.
  One of:
  - 0: Disabled
  - 1: Enabled
  - N/A
