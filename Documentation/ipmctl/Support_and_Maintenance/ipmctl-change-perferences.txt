ipmctl-change-preferences - Modifies one or more user preferences

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Modifies one or more user preferences in the DCPMM software.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl set [OPTIONS] -preferences [PROPERTIES]

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

PROPERTIES
----------
CLI_DEFAULT_DIMM_ID=::
  The default display of DCPMM identifiers. One of:
  - UID: Use the DimmUID attribute as defined in the command Section 2.1.3,
    “Show Device.”
  - HANDLE: Use the DimmHandle attribute as defined in the command Section
    2.1.3, “Show Device. This is the default

CLI_DEFAULT_SIZE=::
  The default display of capacities in the CLI. One of:
  - AUTO: Automatically choose the best format for each capacity in binary
    multiples of bytes (i.e., B, MiB, GiB or TiB). This is the default.
  - AUTO_10: Automatically choose the best format for each capacity in decimal
    multiples of bytes (i.e., B, MB, GB or TB).
  - B: Displays all capacities in bytes.
  - MB: Displays all capacities in megabytes.
  - MiB: Displays all capacities in mebibytes.
  - GB: Displays all capacities in gigabytes.
  - GiB: Displays all capacities in gibibytes.
  - TB: Displays all capacities in terabytes.
  - TiB: Displays all capacities in tebibytes.

PERFORMANCE_MONITOR_ENABLED=::
  Whether or not the monitor is periodically storing performance metrics for the
  DCPMMs in the host server. One of:
  - 0: Disable performance monitoring.
  -1: Enable performance monitoring. This is the default.

PERFORMANCE_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MINUTES=::
  The interval in minutes that the monitor is storing performance metrics (if
  enabled). The default value is 180 minutes and must be >= 1.

EVENT_MONITOR_ENABLED=::
  Whether or not the monitor is periodically checking for DCPMM events.
  - 0: Disable event monitoring.
  - 1: Enable event monitoring. This is the default.

EVENT_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MINUTES=::
  The interval in minutes that the monitor is checking for DCPMM events (if
  enabled). The default value is 1 minutes and must be >= 1.

EVENT_LOG_MAX=::
  The maximum number of events to keep in the management software. The default
  value is 0 (no limit). The valid range is 0 - 2,147,483,647.

DBG_LOG_MAX=::
  The maximum number of debug log entries to keep in the management software.
  The default value is 0 (no limit). The valid range is 0 - 2,147,483,647.

APPDIRECT_SETTINGS=::
  The interleave settings to use when creating App Direct capacity in the
  format: (IMCSize_ChannelSize). Must be one of the BIOS supported App Direct
  settings returned by the command Section 2.1.5, “Show System Capabilities.” +
  Note: ByOne is not a valid setting for this preference. The default is
  “RECOMMENDED” which uses the BIOS recommended App Direct settings. +
  Note: The same interleave settings are used for all the App Direct capacity in
  the system. Therefore, if any App Direct capacity already exists, this
  preference cannot be changed.

APPDIRECT_GRANULARITY=::
  The minimum App Direct granularity per DCPMM supported by the command Section
  2.2.5, “Create Memory Allocation Goal.”. One of:
  - RECOMMENDED: Use the recommended App Direct granularity of 32 GiB.
  - 1: Allows 1 GiB App Direct granularity which may result in App Direct region
       sizes that are not recommended.

DBG_LOG_LEVEL=::
  Whether debug logging is enabled in the DCPMM host software. These logs
  pertain to the operation of the command-line tool only and do not reflect any
  logging functionality of the DCPMM. One of:
  - 0: Logging is disabled. This is the default.
  - 1: Log Errors.
  - 2: Log Warnings, Errors.
  - 3: Log Informational, Warnings, Errors.
  - 4: Log Verbose, Informational, Warnings, Errors.

EXAMPLES
--------
Use DimmUID as the default DCPMM identifier, and display all capacities in bytes.
